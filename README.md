# Real Estate Website

## Overview

The Real Estate Website project is a web application designed to help users search for and explore real estate listings. It offers a user-friendly interface for property searches and detailed property listings. The project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and utilizes Flask for the backend, along with utility functions in `util.py`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **client/**: This folder contains the frontend components of the application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files responsible for the user interface and user experience.

- **server/**: The backend of the application resides here, with `server.py` serving as the Flask server script. It handles user requests, interacts with the utility functions in `util.py`, and provides data to the frontend.

- **server/util.py**: This module houses various utility functions used by the Flask server. These functions help with tasks such as data processing and database interactions.
